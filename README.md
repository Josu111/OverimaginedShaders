#### Hey everyone, thank you for your great interest in Overimagined Shaders. Currently, public development is on hold as Emin has expressed his concerns about the future of Reimagined and our edit. To solve this issue, we agreed on making Overimagined Shaders only available through an installer. Once this installer is ready, public development will continue.

## What is Overimagined Shaders?

Overimagined Shaders, by SpacEagle17 and isuewo, is an edit of EminGT's Complementary Reimagined Shaders. The goal of this edit is to provide more customization options for Complementary Reimagined, while keeping the look and performance as similar to the original as possible. With default settings, Overimagined functions the same as Reimagined; the additional features can be enabled in the shader menu, either individually or together via the Overimagined profile. Overimagined will get updated alongside Complementary Reimagined, so that you won't miss out on any new features.
