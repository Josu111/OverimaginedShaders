# Overimagined Shaders
Overimagined Shaders, by SpacEagle17 and isuewo, was an edit of EminGT's Complementary Reimagined Shaders. The goal of this edit was to provide more customization options for Complementary Reimagined, while keeping the look and performance as similar to the original as possible. With default settings, Overimagined functioned the same as Reimagined; the additional features could be enabled in the shader menu, either individually or together via the Overimagined profile. Overimagined was supposed to get updated alongside Complementary Reimagined, so that you won't miss out on any new features.

## Where is Overimagined Shaders now?
Due to **licensing concerns** by Emin, development was halted for some time, but we've been secretly working on something new that we'll be releasing soon, so stay tuned. In the meantime, we don't recommend downloading Overimagined Shaders anymore, because they are based on a very old version of Complementary Reimagined. That's also why we have **removed the download** option.

However, you are welcome to join the [Complementary Discord](https://discord.gg/A6faFYt) to interact with the community and share your excitement! You can currently find us in the "euphoria-patches" thread under #shader-general if you want to contact us directly.
